					<p>
						COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus discovered in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. It is very
						contagious and has quickly spread around the world. COVID-19 most often causes respiratory
						symptoms
						that can feel much like a cold, a flu, or pneumonia, but COVID-19 can also harm other parts of
						the
						body. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced an official name for the
						disease: coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated COVID-19. ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for
						‘virus,’
						and ‘D’ for disease. The virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is a coronavirus. The word
						corona
						means crown and refers to the appearance that coronaviruses get from the spike proteins sticking
						out
						of them. To protect your family and other people, you should get vaccinated yourself. COVID-19
						vaccines reduce the risk of people getting COVID-19 and can also reduce the risk of spreading
						it. Be
						sure to get everyone in your family who is 12 years or older vaccinated against COVID-19. Wear a
						mask. To maximize protection from the Delta variant and prevent possibly spreading it to others,
						have everyone in your family, even those who are vaccinated, wear a mask indoors in public if
						you
						are in an area of substantial or high transmission. You might choose to have everyone in your
						family, even those who are vaccinated, wear a mask indoors in public regardless of the level of
						transmission in your area. Unvaccinated family members, including children 2 years and older,
						should
						wear a mask in all indoor public settings. To set an example, you also might choose to wear a
						mask.
						Do NOT put a mask on children younger than 2 years old.
